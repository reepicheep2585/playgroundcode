# Git Tutorial: Essential Commands (Push, Pull, Commit, Add, Remove)

## Introduction  
Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. In this tutorial, we will focus on five essential Git commands:  
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git rm`

These commands are crucial for managing changes in your repository.

---

## 1. `git add` â€“ Staging Files  
The `git add` command is used to add changes (new files, modified files) to the staging area before committing.

### Syntax:  
```bash
git add <file>          # Add a specific file
git add .               # Add all changed files in the current directory
git add -A              # Add all changes (staged and unstaged)
```

### Example:  
```bash
git add index.html      # Adds the 'index.html' file to staging
git add .               # Adds all modified files in the project
```

---

## 2. `git commit` â€“ Saving Changes  
The `git commit` command records changes that have been staged with `git add`. It saves a snapshot of the repository.

### Syntax:  
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"  # Commits with a message
git commit -a -m "Commit message"  # Stages and commits all tracked files
```

### Example:  
```bash
git commit -m "Fixed bug in login function"
```
ðŸ”¹ **Tip:** Always write meaningful commit messages to track changes effectively.

---

## 3. `git push` â€“ Uploading Changes  
The `git push` command uploads your local commits to a remote repository.

### Syntax:  
```bash
git push origin <branch>  # Push to a specific branch
git push                  # Push to the current branch (if set up)
git push -u origin <branch>  # Set upstream and push
```

### Example:  
```bash
git push origin main
```
ðŸ”¹ **Tip:** If pushing for the first time, use `git push -u origin main` to set the upstream branch.

---

## 4. `git pull` â€“ Downloading Changes  
The `git pull` command fetches the latest changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

### Syntax:  
```bash
git pull origin <branch>  # Pull changes from a specific branch
git pull                  # Pull changes from the default branch
```

### Example:  
```bash
git pull origin main
```
ðŸ”¹ **Tip:** Use `git pull --rebase` to keep the commit history clean.

---

## 5. `git rm` â€“ Removing Files  
The `git rm` command removes files from the working directory and stages the deletion.

### Syntax:  
```bash
git rm <file>             # Remove a file
git rm -r <directory>     # Remove a directory
git rm --cached <file>    # Remove from staging but keep locally
```

### Example:  
```bash
git rm old_file.txt       # Removes the file and stages the deletion
git rm -r old_directory   # Removes an entire directory
```
ðŸ”¹ **Tip:** If you mistakenly remove a file, recover it using `git checkout -- <file>`.
